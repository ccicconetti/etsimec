## Description

A partial work-in-progress implementation of the [ETSI MEC](https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing) APIs in C++.

This library is used to provide the serverless architecture developed by the [Ubiquitous Internet research group at IIT-CNR](http://cnd.iit.cnr.it/) (not _yet_ released to the public) with an ETSI MEC interface. For more details on this research activity see [here](https://ccicconetti.github.io/cloudcom2018.html) and [here](https://ccicconetti.github.io/percom2019.html).

## Background

The ETSI MEC consists of a set of reference documents defining an architecture to support interoperable edge computing services in a multi-access environment. The reference architecture (v1.1) is illustrated in the figure below.
